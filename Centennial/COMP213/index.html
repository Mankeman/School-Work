<p><h3>Brief Story About Me</h3></p>
<p>I'm currently 22 years old, my birthday being on June 30th. Back when I didn't injure my knee, playing sports was 
honestly how I spent my time.. Soccer, football, shooting hoops in basketball were all fun, but once my knee got injured, I settled down and stayed more indoors, playing videogames and such. Nowadays, if I'm not working or doing school work, I'll be playing PS4/PC games with my friends or going on a date with my girlfriend.</p>
